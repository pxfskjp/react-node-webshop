This project uses Redux. Install Redux with npm install redux react-redux.

1) create store
Create file: store.js in src. In store.js create store and set initialState:
import { createStore, combineReducers } from "redux";

const initialState = {}

const reducer = combineReducers({
  productList: productListReducer,
})  // the reducer is a function that gets a state and an action; it returns
    // a new state based on that action

const store = createStore(reducer, initialState);

2) create reducers folder
Create file productListReducers.js with function productListReducer. This takes
two parameters: state and action. State is an empty productList in this case:
function productListReducer(state= {products:[]}, action)
It is a switch function, with the property 'loading' to indicate an action is
being executed: {loading: true}. The switch is between action types:
function productListReducer(state = { products: [] }, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case PRODUCT_LIST_REQUEST:
      return { loading: true };
    case PRODUCT_LIST_SUCCESS:
      return { loading: false, products: action.payload };
    case PRODUCT_LIST_FAIL:
      return { loading: false, error: action.payload };
    default:
      return state; // no changes, returns existing state. ALWAYS add a default action!
  }
}
DON'T FORGET to export: export { productListReducer }

After this, the reducer is imported into the store:
import { productListReducer } from "./reducers/productReducers"

The store is exported: export default store
The store is added to index.js and used by Provider:
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import store from "./store";
ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);

3) Add applyMiddleware(thunk) to store:
const store = createStore(reducer, initialState, composeEnhancer(applyMiddleware(thunk)));
thunk is middleware for Redux that allows running async operations inside action in Redux.
Install it with npm i redux-thunk, and add to store.js:
import thunk from "redux-thunk"
composeEnhancer should be added:
const composeEnhancer = window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose;
plus add at the top of store.js:
import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware, compose } from "redux";

4) Create folder for actions and add files for separate actions. 

5) Create folder for constants and create a constant for each action: REQUEST, SUCCESS, FAIL.
